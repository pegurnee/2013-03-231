			A mathematician confided<br>
			That the M&#246;bius band is one-sided<br>
			And you'll get quite a laugh<br>
			If you cut one in half<br>
			'Cause it stays in one piece when divided.

			This poem was written by John Saxon (an author of math textbooks).<br>
			((12 + 144 + 20 + (3 * 4^(1/2))) / 7) + (5 * 11) = 9^2 + 0<br>
			<br>
			A Dozen, a Gross and a Score,<br>
			plus three times the square root of four,<br>
			divided by seven,<br>
			plus five times eleven,<br>
			equals nine squared and not a bit more.<br>
