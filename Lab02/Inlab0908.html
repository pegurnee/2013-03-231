		A mathematician confided<br />
		That the M&#246;bius band is one-sided<br />
		And you'll get quite a laugh<br />
		If you cut one in half<br />
		'Cause it stays in one piece when divided.

		This poem was written by John Saxon (an author of math textbooks).<br />
		((12 + 144 + 20 + (3 * 4^(1/2))) / 7) + (5 * 11) = 9^2 + 0<br />
		<br />
		A Dozen, a Gross and a Score,<br />
		plus three times the square root of four,<br />
		divided by seven,<br />
		plus five times eleven,<br />
		equals nine squared and not a bit more.<br />

		3.<br />
		Integral z-squared dz<br />
		from 1 to the cube root of 3<br />
		times the cosine<br />
		of three pi over 9<br />
		equals log of the cube root of 'e'.<br />
		<br />
		<i>And it's correct, too.</i>
